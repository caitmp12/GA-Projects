Marvel Memory Match Game

Loki is up to his old tricks and looking to mess with his older brother's gang of nerds. 

With the power of Dumbledore's wand, he's split each Avenger from their powers. Reunite the Avenger with their ability, until all of the Avengers are back together and able to Smash Loki. 




//Start
Loki is off to the side. All prompts come as text bubbles from his image

The Avengers are each on a "playing card" with their names, super names, and powers listed (from API)

    //This is the original HTML page - no 

Loki prompts, asking if he should split them from their powers. 

Player clicks yes, and the cards split in two. One with the Avenger's name, the other with their power. 

The cards shuffle and turn over

Memory game. As matches are made, the two cards go back to one and move to the top right of the page. 

When all Avengers are "assembled", Loki says to the player, "well, it's been fun. I'll leave you to it, shall I? My, they do look angry. Ta-ta!"

Avengers then say, "Thank you for your help. And don't worry, Loki will not get far."
